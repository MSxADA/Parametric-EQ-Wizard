Interactive Preset Selection: Choose from a wide variety of presets for different music genres and listening scenarios.

Dynamic EQ Curve Visualization: Instantly see the frequency response curve for any selected preset, helping you understand its sonic characteristics.

Precise Parameter Display: A clear, easy-to-read table shows the exact Parametric EQ settings (Filter Type, Frequency, Gain, and Q Factor) for you to enter into your WiiM Home app.

Audiophile-Grade Presets: Settings are carefully crafted based on research to provide an excellent starting point for high-fidelity sound.

Vaporwave Aesthetics: A stylish, dark-themed interface with neon accents that is both beautiful and easy on the eyes.

Fully Responsive: The application is designed to work flawlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Styling: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and utility-first design.

EQ Calculations: The response curve is generated using standard biquad filter transfer function calculations to provide an accurate visualization of the parametric EQ's effect.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
These presets are intended to be a high-quality starting point. The ideal sound is subjective and depends heavily on your personal preferences, your specific audio equipment (speakers/headphones), and the acoustics of your listening environment. Feel free to use these settings as a baseline and tweak them to perfectly match your taste.
